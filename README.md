# Async Redux Lab: Pictures of Cats

Who doesn't want to look at pictures of cats? Well, now you can look at up to 20 pictures of cats with our new React + Redux app. All you have to do is...build it yourself! Let's get started.

## Objectives

1. Use Redux-Thunk middleware to make an asynchronous web request in an action creator function
2. Dispatch an action from the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.

## Instructions

We'll build out our app following the **container pattern**. We'll have one top-level component, `App`, that connects to the store and gets data from the state via `mapStateToProps`. `App` will render a child presentational component, `CatList`, which will receive the list of cat pics from `App` and render them in a series of `<img>` tags.

We'll be getting our cat pics from a real API! Sort of. We made a very special API just for you to use with this lab (aren't you so lucky). Clone down [this repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/cat-api), run `npm install` and `npm start`. If you point your browser to `http://localhost:4000/db` you should see a JSON collection of 20 cat image objects.

Our action creator function will be making a request to `http://localhost:4000/db` to receive these cat images.

### Part 1: Set Up the Store and Reducer and Action Creator

First things first, use Redux's `createStore` function to initialize your store in `src/index.js`. Define your `rootReducer` in `reducers/index.js` to use the `combineReducers` function with your `catsReducer`.

Once you initialize your store with the reducer and middleware, make sure you pass it to the `<Provider>` component and wrap your `<App>` component in the `<Provider>` in `src/index.js`.

Define your `catsReducer` in `src/reducers/cats_reducer`. Your `catsReducer` should respond to one action, an action with a type of `'FETCH_CATS'`.

Define your action creator function, `fetchCats` in `src/actions/catActions`. This action should use `fetch` to make the web request for your cat pic JSON. It should use a `then` function to parse the JSON of the response to this request, and another `.then` function chained on that to grab the actual collection of cat pic image objects. Something like:

```js
fetch('http://localhost:4000/db').then(response => {
  return response.json()
}).then(responseJSON => {
  return responseJSON.images
})
```

Save the results of this `fetch` request to a `const`, `cats`, and make sure your action creator function returns an object with a type of `'FETCH_CATS'` and a payload of the `cats` collection.

### Part 2: Build the Container Component

Your `App` component should use `connect` and `mapStateToProps` to set a prop of `catPics` to the cats collection in state.

#### Dispatching the `fetchCats` action

This is something new, so read carefully...

You might be wondering when/where we will actually dispatch our `fetchCats` action in order to get all the cat pics into state. We want our cat pics to be fetched when the `App` component is first loaded up. So, we'll enact a common pattern in which we hook into a component lifecycle method to fetch the cat pics.

#### The `componentDidMount` function

The `componentDidMount` function will *always be called automatically after `render` gets called by our component, when the component is mounting for the first time*. This is the perfect place to go and get the cat pics.

We can define our `componentDidMount` function like this:

```js
// src/App.js

...

class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // fetch the cats
  }

  render() {
    return (...)
  }
}
```

So, we want to dispatch the `fetchCats` function from inside our component, specifically from inside the  `componentDidMount` function. We'll need to use `mapDispatchToProps` in order to make our `fetchCats` function dispatch-able from within our component.

Once you successfully fetch cats, put them in state, grab them from state and pass them to `App` under the `catPics` prop, you're ready to build the `CatList` component.

### The Presentational Component

Your container component, `App`, should render the presentational component, `CatList`. `App` should pass `catPics` down to `CatList` as a prop. `CatList` should iterate over the cat pics and display each cat pic in an image URL. Remember to use debugger to take a look at the `catPics` collection and determine which property of each `catPic` object you will use to populate your `<img>` tag and render the image.
